# Continuous-Monitoring-Program-for-Third-Party-Risk

## Objective
Simulated the design and implementation of a scalable, risk-based continuous monitoring program for third-party vendors. The program establishes KRIs (Key Risk Indicators), escalation thresholds, and a structured monitoring cadence based on vendor tier and criticality.

### Key Deliverables
- Defined a 10-vendor ecosystem categorized by Risk Tier and Business Criticality
- Developed 8 realistic KRIs including policy/cert expiry, OSINT alerts, and offboarding delays
- Classified KRIs by severity (Critical, Moderate, Low) to drive risk-based escalation
- Built tier-based monitoring frequency and escalation matrix
- Created a functional KRI Monitoring Log with simulated risk scenarios and escalation paths
- Integrated real-world TPRM practices such as SLA tracking, policy compliance, and external intelligence

#### Skills Developed

- KRI Design & Implementation
- Escalation & Incident Response Planning
- Program Design Based on Risk Tiering
- Policy Alignment (OSFI B-10, NIST, ISO 27001)
